mongoSQL is a SQL user interface for MongoDB.  It allows one to enter SQL
and execute that SQL and get results back from MongoDB without having to
construct JSON and/or write Javascript.  Additionally, a SQL statement can be
disected: it will be broken into the appropriate JSON and/or Javascript and
displayed so that it can be used directly with the MongoDB APIs.  For SQL
that requires aggregation, either the MongoDB aggregation framework (default)
or map reduce can be used.  (Much more detail is available via Help when
running the application.)

mongoSQL will run on any machine that has Java 1.6 or greater installed on it.

Either Java must be in your path or the run_xnix file (or run_windows.bat
file for Windows) must be edited to use the path to Java.

Changes in version 1.5.002:
    - Fixed bug.  If a SELECT statement has at least one aggregate function
      but no group-by fields, exactly one document needs to be returned.
      MongoDB will not produce any documents in this case so the logic is a
      part of the post processing.  Previously no documents were returned in
      this case.
    - Fixed bug.  Previously, if a portion of the script was selected in the
      UI, the start and end column was not being calculated correctly.  (The
      start and end row were calculated correctly though.)

Changes in version 1.5.001:
    - Added condition support for:
      - EXISTS
      - NOT EXISTS
    - Added the options:
      - OPTION STRICT NULL COMPARE OFF (default)
      - OPTION STRICT NULL COMPARE ON.
    - Minor bug fixes.
